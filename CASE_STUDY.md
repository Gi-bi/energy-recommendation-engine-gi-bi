### Strategic Problem
Power grids across the US face increasing instability as demand patterns become unpredictable during extreme weather events:
1. **Extreme Weather Events**: Heat waves and cold snaps causing simultaneous energy spikes
2. **Grid Failures**: Catastrophic blackouts when thousands of buildings spike consumption simultaneously
3. **Demand Response Gap**: Existing solutions rely on generic, uncoordinated recommendations
4. **Operational Complexity**: No system could learn from building-specific behavior patterns and optimize recommendations at the portfolio level

## Solution Overview

### Integrated Approach
The solution implements a multi-stage ML pipeline connecting building-specific forecasting with portfolio-level optimization:

- **Stage 1: Multi-Cohort Forecasting**: LSTM neural network predicting 24-hour demand for 15 building types
- **Stage 2: Compliance Prediction**: Realistic modeling of which buildings will actually follow recommendations
- **Stage 3: Portfolio Optimization**: Coordinated selection maximizing grid impact across building portfolio
- **Production Engineering**: <30 seconds processing for 8,000+ buildings with <50MB memory usage

### Key Differentiators
- **Portfolio-Level Coordination**: System-wide optimization vs. individual building approaches
- **Realistic Compliance Modeling**: Industry research-based rates (36.3%) vs. theoretical maximums
- **Production-Ready Architecture**: Scalable, reliable system enabling immediate commercial deployment
- **Performance Engineering**: Aggressive latency requirements while maintaining prediction accuracy
