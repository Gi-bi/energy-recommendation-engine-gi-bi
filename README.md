## 🎯 Model Selection Philosophy

### Production-First Performance Requirements

This project demonstrates the critical balance between model accuracy and production deployment requirements:

- **Latency Requirements**: <30 seconds end-to-end processing for 8,000+ buildings
- **Memory Constraints**: <50MB memory usage for cost-effective cloud deployment
- **Scalability**: Architecture supporting 100,000+ building deployment scenarios
- **Reliability**: Production-grade error handling and fallback procedures

### Multi-Stage Architecture Decision

Rather than attempting end-to-end deep learning, I chose a modular three-stage approach:

1. **Stage 1: Multi-Cohort Forecasting** - LSTM neural network predicting 24-hour demand for 15 building types
2. **Stage 2: Compliance Prediction** - Realistic modeling of which buildings will actually follow recommendations
3. **Stage 3: Portfolio Optimization** - Coordinated selection maximizing grid impact across building portfolio

**Why This Architecture**: Enables parallel development, allows individual stage optimization, and provides interpretable decision points for utility operators.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 1.12+
- 8GB+ RAM for large building datasets
- Access to NREL Commercial Building Stock Data
