## 🎯 Model Selection Philosophy

### Production-First Performance Requirements

This project demonstrates the critical balance between model accuracy and production deployment requirements:

- **Latency Requirements**: <30 seconds end-to-end processing for 8,000+ buildings
- **Memory Constraints**: <50MB memory usage for cost-effective cloud deployment
- **Scalability**: Architecture supporting 100,000+ building deployment scenarios
- **Reliability**: Production-grade error handling and fallback procedures

### Multi-Stage Architecture Decision

Rather than attempting end-to-end deep learning, I chose a modular three-stage approach:

1. **Stage 1: Multi-Cohort Forecasting** - LSTM neural network predicting 24-hour demand for 15 building types
2. **Stage 2: Compliance Prediction** - Realistic modeling of which buildings will actually follow recommendations
3. **Stage 3: Portfolio Optimization** - Coordinated selection maximizing grid impact across building portfolio

**Why This Architecture**: Enables parallel development, allows individual stage optimization, and provides interpretable decision points for utility operators.

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🔬 Technical Innovations

### Multi-Output LSTM Architecture

I developed a specialized neural network architecture for commercial building energy forecasting:

- **15 building cohort-specific prediction heads** covering >94% of commercial building stock
- **48-hour weather lookback window** capturing thermal lag effects in building systems
- **Temporal validation splits** preventing data leakage (critical for time series reliability)

**Performance Achievement**: 12.4% MAPE under normal conditions, 23-28% MAPE during extreme weather—within production-viable range for commercial building applications.

### Portfolio Coordination Algorithm

I designed the optimization stage to balance individual building constraints with system-wide objectives:

- **Constraint-based optimization** respecting building operational limitations
- **Grid strain detection** identifying critical intervention periods
- **Coordinated response planning** across diverse building types and sizes

**Business Impact**: Achieved 5.4% aggregate reduction through coordinated recommendations vs. 2-3% typical for uncoordinated approaches.

### Production-Ready Data Pipeline

I built robust data infrastructure handling real-world operational constraints:

- **625 building characteristics** with systematic missing data handling
